This is a little pathfinding demo I make back in 2005 (judging from the files).

You need allegro to build it.
Allegro is a graphic library ala SDL, which released not very long ago a version 5 using hardware acceleration.
This stuff obviously use the version 4 API.

The package should be lib-allegro4.x on debian-like systems.



Usage:

Left click to set the starting point.

Then Right click to set the target.

Watch.

Escape when you want to quit.



You can modify test.bmp to experiment.
Black zones are "walkable", white zones are not.
